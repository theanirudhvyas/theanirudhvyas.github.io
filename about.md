I'm a student at IIT Jodhpur. With a major in Systems Science and a minor in Computer Science, I am in my senior year of college. I am deeply passionate about data science and machine learning and how they are changing the landscape of our worlds today.

Besides my technical (read nerdy) interests I am an amateur photographer and designer. I like to Run, Cook and Binge-watch whatever I can get my hands on.

I love to read books, and you would rarely catch me without one. I'm fascinated by the knowledge and wisdom that these little bundles of paper carry and strive to squeeze every ounce of it.

Being an Engineering student I look up to science for all the answers I yearn and this has weakened my belief in god over the years. An idea that has caught my attention recently is Atheism 2.0

Inspired by people like <a href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a> ,<a href="http://tim.blog"> Tim Ferriss</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">Casey Neistat</a> , I strive to live a better life by helping others and telling stories.
