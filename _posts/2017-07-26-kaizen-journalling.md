title: Journaling and Kaizen
---

I have been reading a lot of self-help books lately and with every new concept I come across and every new book I pick up I feel inspired and somehow empowered with all this knowledge. But when I look closely and analyze logically, I haven't implemented a single thing from any book and so the effort of reading all those books returned zero value.

But worry not, I think I have found a solution or rather stumbled upon a solution to my problem (and possible yours too!). So a couple of days ago
_Ranjan Sakalley_, the VP of Engineering at Go-Jek, said that he logs his feelings and behaviors everyday to improve upon them. This did not make sense to me at the time but once I let it seep in, I cannot think of a more sound logic for personal improvement.

This ties in closely with the concept of Kaizen. **Kaizen** is the Japanese word for `continual improvement`. The word refers to any improvement, one-time or continuous, large or small. It subscribes to the idea of making marginal improvements everyday, so that you improve exponentially over a longer timeline.

So, how does this tie in with journalling? Well, to make changes for the better you need data to base your decisions on and to validate them. And as a general rule you never make decisions on individual data points, instead you base your reasoning on trends or patterns that can be seen in the data. So when you log your behaviors you get these patterns that you can then act upon.
What Ranjan advised was to start with a simple log where you write down the behaviour that you want to track, it could be something as simple as how many times were you rude or angry during the day. Then once you get the data for say 7 days, you look at the pattern and make changes.

In my opinion this approach alone could accelerate your improvements and act as a catalyst for those self-help books. Start with a simple log and let me know how it is helping you!
