title: Automating Project Creation in Ruby

  In my world, You either automate or you die!

So last week I started working at this crazy (read amazingly awesome) place called Go-jek. This is my first job after graduating a little over 2 months ago and I could have never hoped of learning so much right out of college. Go-jek is popularly referred to as the world's fastest growing startup, but I have my own reasons to call it fast, brutally fast.
Within two days of joining we started the bootcamp, and yes as the name suggest it as brutal as an army one. We are being taught to think, talk and code more logically and efficiently. Our coach Sidu (I think he would prefer sensei instead of coach) is a phenomenal orator and programmer but the standards he has set sometimes seem too high to sail through and that is when the dreaded ```<rm -rf>``` comes in.
We have been given a list of non-negotiable Etiquette list (code Etiquette) and whenever you are found breaking one of those said rules you are expected to delete all your code and start from scratch. So as you would imagine almost all of us had to go through this hell of deleting all your progress and starting again. So much so that yesterday I spent all morning and afternoon creating project structures and folders and files and readme(s), it was getting frustrating.

 And then Sensei said something that caught my attention  
> <cite> True productivity is in automating repetitive things. </cite>

You see projects in a specific language have specific directory structure conventions and naming conventions and creation of such projects is a mechanical and time consuming task, so why not automate it.
So today, I set out to automate the initialization of my ruby projects. Now a lot of you might say that bundler does this out of the box, and to that I say "Stop being such a boring wuss and make something of your own!" and also a lot of the files that bundler automatically creates are useless to me at this point. So I made my own ruby script tailored for my needs and easily hackable. Go check out the script and let me know how you hacked it for your own use!

After all we aspire to be code ninjas
