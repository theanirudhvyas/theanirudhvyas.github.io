How many people can you afford to be hit by the truck
</div>
The **Truck Factor**, also referred to as the bus factor, is the measure of risk or danger your team is under due to the absence of one or more members. More explicitly, truck factor is the answer to the question "How many people from your team have to be hit by a truck before your project comes to a halt?".
Now it is important to note that being hit by a bus is only an analogy and you don't have to go around town running over your team member with a truck to get your truck factor. For those of you who take this quite literally I'll rephrase the question "the absence of how many members of the team will halt the project?".

If your truck factor is low it means that the absence of only 1 member will stop everything and this is a bad place to be in. You have to strive to get the highest possible truck factor, the Holy Grail for which is even if one member is left in the team your project should go on.

Now, this conversation is part of an over-arching conversation of the paradigm shift of developers towards devops from traditional specialized teams. In specialized teams, if members of a single team are absent your project is in great danger. This also effectively destroys Hero cultures in teams, if you have a member of the team that has become too important for the project or is a hero or the savior of the team you are doing something wrong because again it is bringing down your truck factor.

Ideally all your members should be on the same level and everyone should grow together to go farther.
