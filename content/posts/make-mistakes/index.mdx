For the longest time I remember, I have been terrified of making mistakes, or at least that is what I thought what my fear was. I would use perfection as a crutch to put off things and procrastinate. For instance, I have been putting off starting a blog for a long long time, justifying it with the excuse that I am not good at writing or I do not have the content to start a blog. And I emphasize on the word excuse as these are illogical justifications for my laziness and the fear of the unknown.

I know you have been putting off things as well, waiting for the right moment or the perfect circumstances when all the planets will align and grant you the clarity you so desperately desire, but let me tell you this, it is **NEVER** going to happen.
> The right time is now and the right circumstances are the ones you are in right now.

It took me 4 years to realize this, four years of lost opportunities and experiences but I've started now and **NOW** is the best moment to start. Stop making perfection a wall that stops you from doing things and realize that it is perfectly fine to make mistakes when you are starting out, as the saying goes
```
If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying something new!
```
So now, I go out of my way to try new things and make mistakes, but I still strive for perfection. Don't get me wrong, you should strive for perfection, mediocrity is a bad place to live in, but keep in mind that it is Okay to be wrong. It is Okay to not know things, it is Okay to forget, *as long as you learn from the process.*

I might go as fas as saying that you should ```"get used to making a fool of yourself!"``` Life will always be unclear, uncertain, there will never come a time when you will have enough information and so you have to make do with this uncertainty, and with uncertainty comes imperfection. So with this line of reasoning, you can never attain perfection, so why use it as an excuse!

***JUST DO IT!***
